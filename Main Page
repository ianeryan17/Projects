# Welcome to my project repository. My name is Ian Ryan, and I am a junior at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Architectural Studies. This repository holds various examples of work that I've done in the last couple of years. The majority of this work is schoolwork from the classes that I've taken in my major. Additionally, there is also work from my summer internship at AQUA.xyz, where I helped develop three web3 based video games.
